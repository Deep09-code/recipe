Butter paneer masala
This recipe is about the paneer that is a cottage cheese prepared with tomatoes and spices
you can also add cashews to make it thick.

The major ingredient is the cashew. If you do not add the cashew, the gravy would not be thick as there is tomato puree in it which makes it liquidy.
