Butter paneer masala line 2 changed remotely
This recipe is about the paneer that is a cottage cheese prepared with tomatoes and spices
you can also add cashews to make it thick.

The major ingredient is the cashew. If you do not add the cashew, the gravy would not be thick as there is tomato puree in it which makes it liquidy.
The recipe also requires iron utensils which gives the masala a perfect flavour and adds iron content to it, that makes it more healthy. 
I would recommend adding the mustard oil for aroma and it is also healthy as compared to the other oils.
